# Changelog

## 1.6
- macOS Big Sur
- Apple silicon
- Minimum deployment target 10.13
- Fixed an issue where matching contact for an incoming call could not
  be found when the incoming phone number was exactly the same length
  as the significant phone number setting and the contact's phone
  number was longer than that.
